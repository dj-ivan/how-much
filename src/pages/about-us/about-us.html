        <span>At CutBack, we have been in and out of all the different finance apps and calculators!</span>
        <span>We found through our financial adventures that no app or spreadsheet achieved what we were looking to achieve! </span>
        <span>That is, to have an app that will actually help us budget our money properly!</span>
        <span>That is where CutBack came to life!</span>
        <span>Let's meet the team!</span>
